navigate to an aruco marker.

channel, always publishing position of the marker in our coordinate system and bot


BRAIN SCENARIO #1 (no obstacles)
brain is just verifying and choosing neighbors

PICKUP
    bot wants a bobbin
    bot signals to BRAIN i want a bobbin
    BRAIN finds closest bobbin for the bot
        we know its close cuz BRAIN measured distances to all bobbins and found closest one
    then BRAIN sends rotation instruction to the bot
    BOT recieves (target heading) and rotates to meet it
    BOT activates locomotion (always chekcing heading) and moves to BOBBIN until reaches READY2GRAB distance
    BOT signals BRAIN, is my position okay?
    BRAIN verifies if position in tolerance
        BRAIN halts (step 1) or BRAIN corrects (step 2)
    if position is okay, BOT intiates pickup behavior (turn 90s,verify distance, grab and lift)
    BOT checks if bobbin in gripper
        does a wiggle
    if its OKAY signal BRAIN that BOT has a bobbin

"REPEAT ABOVE STEPS (aka PICKUP) TO GET ANOTHER BOBBIN"

collision avoidance on arduino (LOCAL) ramdom heading for x seconds
then return to locomote/heading

once BRAIN sees there are TWO bobbins, says do a TWIST
or LOCAL to bot








the brain > takes the last published coordinate of bot and bobbin,
    computes distance and vector
